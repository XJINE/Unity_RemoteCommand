## How to Use

Set ``RemoteCommand`` attribute and the unique id.

```csharp
[RemoteCommand(ID = 1)]
public float SampleCommandArgsReturn(int ivalue, float fvalue)
{
    Debug.Log("SampleCommandReturn " + ivalue + ", " + fvalue);
    return ivalue + fvalue;
}

â€¦

object sum = RemoteCommander.Instance.Command(1, 999, 3.14f)
